In SA, combining our vaccination rate (15%) with the recovered portion of our population  (70%) the portion protected against severe disease is higher compared to that of Denmark. 

SA should follow suit and also drop all restrictions.#####2 of 3:

Denmark has realised that the inevitable endpoint will be when sufficient people have had the disease, regardless of vaccination levels. The safest time to get the disease is 1-3 months after full vaccination.

The vulnerable are advised to continue taking extra care.#####1 of 3:

Denmark has lifted all restrictions. High trust in government and healthcare has resulted in high vaccination rates without mandates.

You know them personally. I know thousands of people and not one has had a complication following vaccination.#####@XolaniXtx @Lephutshe And again, what this also highlights is that even among those who got infected before, if they get vaccinated, they’re protected even more.

Imagine knowing there's a chance you might be hospitalised for heart issues following a vaccine? (it's there i know people who had it happen). That's not as straightforward...#####@atlaspurred @MaureenStroud You know what I want? I want the world to return to normal. I want not to die if I contract COVID. I want a free ICU bed if someone I love happens to have a heart attack and not to be told that bed is taken by a vaccine denier who has COVID complications.#####@MaureenStroud @xeyedmess No it's not as simple as that, to think so you basically only see the world through one lens, snd you're not right.

My risk calculation is so small for my age group that there's no benefit to taking a 3 month lasting vaccine. In fact there's risk involved.#####@SABreakingNews I hope they are all vaccinated!#####@XolaniXtx @Lephutshe This article pretty much says the rise in deaths  deaths among vaccinated have been worrying due to waning immunity and better for those with a booster which indicates additional immunity. However, this still doesn’t compare the standardised deaths of vaccinated vs unvaccinated.#####By 17:00 today only 21% of the adult population was fully vaccinated.
Herd/population immunity is reached when 67% of the population are fully vaccinated.

The side wanting freedom only for the vaccinated are science deniers too.#####@Alostro_ZA @RyanJohnson_007 @News24 @Health24com Au contraire.
