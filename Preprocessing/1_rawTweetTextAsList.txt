More than 90% of Harvard University community is vaccinated but the university is struggling to let the spread down and it is now doing online classes.#####@AfricaCheck So you don't know that these so called vaccines you are advocating for are TRIAL Vaccines, have you seen people dying from side effects? Politicians who publicly question Vaccine efficacy get sacked from their posts?
They have disclaimers that they are not resposible for any#####I mean... That's literally why you take the vaccine and wear masks... So you don't have to worry about covid... https://t.co/fM1909Ssss#####As we prepare to get vaccinated this weekend, we need to remember to continue practising COVID-19 safety guidelines by wearing a mask, keep social distancing and frequently sanitise our hands in public. #VoomaVaccination https://t.co/G60VoFkckH#####Two clients this week shared particularly troubling vaccine side effects to their first jab. One appears to be myocarditis. 

I asked them both if they reported the reactions. Their answers were identical: “nope, I just won’t get the second jab”

So we must trust what data?#####@shazam_za @Alostro_ZA @RyanJohnson_007 @News24 @Health24com A study recommendation combined with trial documentation (Pfizer) says there is something there. People experiencing symptoms after having spent close time with vaccinated people is not recorded at the moment, from what I know. I have, however, heard of multiple reports.#####@agent_agitator @Dennistalksfact @NickHudsonCT @PanData19 Nope, I've read the ones I don't like too. That's the reason I'm familiar with Pierre Kory, for example.

No one has ever said nothing other than vaccines work. Issue is people deciding for themselves what works and using it, while at the same time calling the vaccine untested.#####"Activists take vaccine demands, and a mountain of fake bones, to the home of Biden’s Chief of Staff"

Which one caught your attention?#####@SolidarityRSA @MoloantwaM Like Those R350 allocated to your people.let the vaccine  follow suit.. Take mine and be super  protected.######VoomaVaccination Weekend starts tomorrow! 🙌Are you 18 years or older and not #vaccinated yet?

#ChooseToVaccinate #VacciNATION #IChooseVacciNation######NicholasCrisp, the #ActingDGofHealth, has advised #SATaxpayers NOT to concern themselves with the details of #ConsequenceManagement flowing from the #DigitalVibesReport, but to instead focus on getting vaccinated! The sheer arrogance &amp; condescension from this bureaucrat!#####
